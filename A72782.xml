         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And that further, humble ſuite may be made to the Kings Highneſſe, That all perſons hauing Lands or Tenements along the Riuerſide, vpon certaine paine by his Highneſſe, and the Lords of his moſt Honourable Councell, to be limited, ſhall well and ſufficiently repayre and maintaine, all the Walles and Bankes adioyning to their ſaid Lands, ſo that the water may not, nor ſhall breake in vpon the ſame. And the ſame to be continued, vntill the time the ſaide no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Riuer be brought againe to his old courſe and former eſtate. And that ſtrong grates of Iron along the ſaid water ſide, and alſo by the ſtreete ſide, where any water-courſe is had into the ſaide <hi>Thames,</hi> bee made by the Inhabitants of euery Ward, ſo along the ſaid Water, as of old time hath beene accuſtomed. And that euery grate be in height, foure and twenty inches at the leaſt: or more, as the place ſhall neede: and in bredth one from another, one inch. And the ſame to be done with all expedition and ſpeede. And if the Occupiers of the ſaide Lands and Tenements make default contrary to the ordinance aforeſaide: or elſe if any perſon or perſons, in great raines or other times, ſweepe their ſoylage or filth of their houſes into the Chanell and the ſame after is conueyed into the <hi>Thames,</hi> euery perſon ſo offending, ſhall forfeite for euery ſuch default twenty pence: and that vpon complaint to be made to any Conſtable next adioyning to the ſaide place, where any ſuch default ſhall be found, it ſhall be lawfull for the ſaid Conſtable or his ſufficient Deputie for the time being, from time to time to diſtraine for the ſame offence. And to retaine the ſame irreplegiable, and like law to be obſerued, and kept, and like penalty to be paide for euery perſon, that burne ruſhes and ſtraw in their houſes, or waſh in the common ſtreets or Lanes, and to be recouered as aforeſaid: and the one moity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to be to the Maior and Commonaltie: and the other moity to bee diuided betweene the ſaid Conſtable that taketh paine, and the party finder of the ſaide fault. And if the Conſtable or his Deputie for the time being refuſe to doe his dutie according to the true meaning of this Act, That then the Conſtable or his Deputie, which ſhall ſo refuſe to do his dutie, as aforeſaid, ſhall forfeit and pay for euery time offending, three ſhillings and foure pence.
